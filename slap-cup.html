            <h2>Slap Cup Rules</h2>

            <ul class="rules">
                <li class="rule">20 Cups.</li>
                <li class="rule">Leave two empty cups and give them to two players that are standing opposite of each
                    other, along with 1 pong ball each. The game will begin with those two players.</li>
                <li class="rule">The rules are straight forward: the two solo cup & pong ball combinations are passed
                    after the ball is bounced into the cup. If the ball was bounced in on the first try, that player can
                    pass the ball & cup to a player of their choosing as long as they don't have the other one.
                    Otherwise, they have to pass the ball & cup to the player on their right.</li>
                <li class="rule">If you and the player to your left are shooting and the player to you left bounces his
                    ball into his cup first, they slap your cup (before you make the ball into it), forcing you to drink
                    (take a drink from the pool in the middle of the table). You then try to bounce your ball into the
                    cup that you just drank from, and the player to your left that slapped your cup passes their ball &
                    cup to the player on your right - they don't have to wait for you to drink - so drink quickly!
