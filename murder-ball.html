            <h2>Murder Ball Rules</h2>

            <ul class="rules">
                <li class="rule">Each team will get on each side of the table and place their bottled down whenever as
                    long as it is close to the edge of the table.</li>
                <li class="rule">The objective of the game is for your whole team to finish their beer before the other
                    team can. If one teammate finished their beer before the other teammate, that teammate can still
                    continue.</li>
                <li class="rule">You need to throw the ping pong ball across the table and try to hit the other teams
                    bottles with the ball. While the other team is attempting to recover the ball the person who just
                    threw the ball will grab their own beer and start drinking as much of it as they can before the ball
                    is recovered and brought back over the defending teams side of the table. After the ball is brought
                    back to the table it is now that teams turn to go on offense and throw the ball. Once one person
                    finished their bottle completely they can remove it from the table and when it is their turn to
                    throw somebody else from their team will drink their own beer if they manage to hit a bottle on the
                    opposing side. The game is over once one team manages to finish all their beers made them the
                    winners. (ONE BEER PER TEAMMATE â€“ TWO BEERS IN TOTAL).</li>
                <li class="rule">No one is allowed to touch the ball.</li>
                <li class="rule">If any beer is spilled during the game a single member of the opposing team gets to
                    take a sip from their own beer so try not to spill anything!.</li>
            </ul>
